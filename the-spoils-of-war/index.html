<p>The idea that you could forecast Russia or any direct victims of it&rsquo;s actions to any great extent in the current environment is a delusion that economists occupy themselves with only because their bosses think it&rsquo;s relevant. As all victims are at the direct mercy of Russia&rsquo;s market share of the worlds energy, you cannot forecast Germany for the same reason that you cannot feed a mathematical risk-management model inputs that exclude any third standard deviation scenarios and then expect it to perform well in practice, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">right</a>? Thus we will turn our eyes away from the dancing monkey and focus on something a bit taboo; who will reap the rewards, and how? Yes, there are winners in war.</p>
<h2 id="the--problem">the € problem</h2>
<p>One could reasonably expect an export-heavy economy like Germany to benefit from a slump in the €&rsquo;s exchange rate, generally that would be the correct assumption, but if we consider that they are importing inflation at it&rsquo;s highest on record a weak exchange rate might not seem like a great deal anymore as it pours even more gas on the fire which is imported inflation. This is further exaggerated by the fact that most inflation originates in non-Eurozone supply chains, thus the exchange rate is a major player in deciding who is at the better end of the deal.</p>
<p><img src="/images/germanImportExport-07-15-2022.png" alt="German Import &amp; Export prices"></p>
<p>To make the scenario even more obnoxious the European Central Bank is expected to hike interest rates into a horrible consumer economy, for example, a major source of European trade comes from vehicles and with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-15/europe-car-sales-slump-to-worst-june-in-decades-on-supply-issues">European car sales having fallen 17% year-over-year</a> it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the market is very strong. Now consider that supply chains are finally easing, as companies have fought nail &amp; tooth over contracts for supplies at record prices [ especially semi-conductors, which are high-tech and thus highly innovative markets ] so they could support what was expected to be strong consumer demand and are instead met with crushed consumer sentiment.</p>
<p>With a weak global economy, it&rsquo;s classic for investors to rotate their money from risky debt/currencies into what&rsquo;s considered safe havens, such as US sovereign debt. This rotation into US sovereign debt and away from volatile European or emerging market currencies cause massive flows to the $. Since restructuring oppourtunities for debt are scarce in the hike-cycle [ The part of the economic cycle where central banks are raising interest rates ] all $ denominated debt becomes more expensive to pay for entities that do not get paid in $ themselves, which further worsens the economy, which further drives inflows to the $ and thus weakens the € creating more import inflation. Since a lot of energy dealings are made in the $ there is a double whammy which further puts pressure on energy prices, which increases inflation. The higher inflation and weakened economy thus drive more flows to the $, collapsing the € and creating more import inflation which the ECB [ European Central Bank ] counters by raising rates, which further weakens the economy - which drives flows away from € and the whole thing loops over again. This is obviously not a great scenario to be in for the ECB, but even worse is that it&rsquo;s unusually dependant on $ denominated energy imports because of the sanctions on Russian gas.</p>

<p><img src="/images/eurozone-vs-china-inflation-07-18-2022.png" alt="Eurozone HCPI vs China&amp;rsquo;s CPI"></p>
<p>With the western world desperately looking to fill their gas reserves after Putin cut flows to 40% of capacity [ and he might not be done cutting yet ] with inflation at 4 decade highs, China continues moving along at their target inflation rate, no markets having priced in any near-term rate hikes and they have no worries of gas shortages after having <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-russia-china-agree-30-year-gas-deal-using-new-pipeline-source-2022-02-04/">contracted Russian gas</a> at pre-war rates days before the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>As Europe &amp; North America combat&rsquo;s increasingly more dramatic climate change induced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/health-warnings-issued-heatwave-scorches-europe-2022-07-15/">heatwaves</a> and scramble to replace their dependance on Russian energy they turn to clean-energy solutions whose supply chains are <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/the-world-needs-more-diverse-solar-panel-supply-chains-to-ensure-a-secure-transition-to-net-zero-emissions">dominated by China</a> at the same time as skepticism regarding clean energy is at it&rsquo;s peak in recent years and more are pushing for a return to domestic fossil-fuel solutions, like fracking in the US.</p>
<p>Now with the focus once again turning to the Middle East as a major player in world politics due to their influence through OPEC [ Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ] and America&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-refiners-turn-middle-east-fuel-oil-after-russia-import-ban-2022-03-24/">now more significant dependance</a> on middle eastern energy imports, Russia &amp; China relaxes knowing full well that the Biden administration won&rsquo;t make much progress diplomatically with the OPEC nations unless they <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62155165">sever negotiations with Iran</a>, letting Russia &amp; China take control of the region exploiting their now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-meet-erdogan-raisi-next-tuesday-kremlin-2022-07-12/">US-hostile proxy state</a> while money markets are forecasting the US heading for an inflationary recession. In the end, China is set to benefit from US-Iran negotiations breaking down and Russia-Iran relations strenghtening as it will have two major energy suppliers both heavily sanctioned by the west desperate to raise capital through energy trade.</p>
<p>In combination with it&rsquo;s strong rebound in manufacturing &amp; services while still employing lenient monetary &amp; fiscal policy China is positioned to gain an immense pricing power advantage since Europe has centralized all their demand for goods within South East Asian dominated supply chains where most economies still suffer from supply chain issues and are just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/further-pain-store-asian-currencies-after-turbulent-first-half-2022-06-30/">slightly late in the economic cycle</a> relative to Europe.</p>
<p><img src="/images/china-manufacturing_services-07-18-2022.png" alt="Chinese Manuf. and Services PMI"></p>
<p>Something about having 40% energy dependance on your top rivals as a consequence of having rushed the transformation to clean energy because you don&rsquo;t want to be dependant on your rivals is a bit ironic.</p>
<h2 id="chinas-tech-crackdown">china&rsquo;s tech crackdown</h2>
<p>After having read all this you might be surprised [ assuming no finance background ] to find that even after China has had one of it&rsquo;s best decades ever in terms of economic growth and is actively positioned to benefit tremendously from the ongoing change in world order, economically and culturally, Chinese large-cap stocks are nevertheless changing hands at prices equivalent to what they were in late 2008 and below what they were during the peak of Covid market volatility. There is great reason for this, and although it&rsquo;s complex and deserves it&rsquo;s own article completely, I will do my best to <strong>summarize</strong> what has brought us here.</p>
<p>In November 2020 the Chinese government striked down what would&rsquo;ve been the largest IPO (Initial Public Offering) of all time pointing to national security concerns. The company to IPO was the financial focused subsidiary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba Group</a>, Ant Group, which owns Alipay, the world&rsquo;s largest mobile payment platform with 1.3b users [ China as of writing has a population of 1.4b ] that rivals Paypal. The majority shareholder &amp; founder of Ant Group aswell as Alibaba, Jack Ma, had directed criticism to Chinese authorities days before the IPO was to take place&ndash;this is where Ma notoriously went into hiding and rumors began to spread of his demise.</p>
<p>Just one day before Singles&rsquo; day [ the biggest shopping festival in the world pioneered in 2009 by Alibaba ] the Chinese authorities announced a draft of new guidelines that would address monopolisitic behaviour&ndash;with a heavy focus on user data collection. It came quite unexpectedly seeing as how the intervention in Ant Group&rsquo;s IPO just 7 days prior was a change in pace regarding regulation, after a long period of relaxed market regulation. In december of the same year China&rsquo;s markets watchdog, The State Administration for Market Regulation, opened an investigation into Alibaba Group citing concerns of monopolistic behaviour on online platforms.</p>
<p>In January 2021 Jack Ma reappears after having been missing from public view for just under 3 months, the context is him speaking as host at an event dedicated to teachers in rural China, vowing to spend more of his time on philanthropy. In March, the tech companies Tencent, Baidu &amp; Bytedance are fined for not having sought approval prior to making past acquisitons, although it was a modest fine [ &lt; $100k ] it prefaced what was about to come in the continuing crackdown of bigtech. Just a month later, Alibaba Group is fined $2.8b dollars pointing to abuse of Alibaba&rsquo;s dominant position in markets, breaking the previous record fine the Chinese authorities had handed out by 300%.</p>
<p>Two days after Alibaba was handed the record fine Ant Group announces an overhaul of it&rsquo;s business model where it will now be regulated as a banking entity and authorities will have more direct control of it&rsquo;s business operations, for example they now have to let competitors make use of Alipay. Here the target shifts to what is commonly known as fin-tech [ companies who appear to be mainly tech oriented but under the hood operate as financial holding companies ] by handing out fines to 13 companies, enforcing new requirements regarding data collection and forcing restructioning of major financial divisions of tech companies.</p>
<p>The crackdown peaks in intensity in July as Didi Global is subject to investigation two days after it&rsquo;s overseas IPO, once again directed at user data collection and how it will be protected, forcing Didi to halt new users from signing up. This is followed up by stricter rules for companies that are listed or have ambition to IPO on foreign exchanges, including requirements to go through a cybersecurity investigation prior to listing. The crackdown continues although in a much slower pace from here on out.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fxi-summary-07-18-2022.png" alt="FXI with crackdown points marked"></p>
<p>Now that we have discussed the initial crackdown, let&rsquo;s cover the monetary &amp; fiscal policy easing that quickly followed. Ant Group, whose IPO was cancelled and forced into restructuring, was in June given approval to restart it&rsquo;s plans to IPO in Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai. The investigation of Didi Global was recently concluded and the company was fined $1.2b for what was described as serious violations of national security over a seven year period, thus likely marking the end of regulatory troubles for Didi as they would not hand out such a significant fine if there was more to be addressed. Chinese authorities have also worked with their bigtech companies to prevent further violations by making their rules clear, rather than shocking companies with big fines that have vague origins. Many prominent politicians or political institutions like the People&rsquo;s Bank of China have voiced the need for easier market conditions, including Politburo members like Liu He. They have also resumed handing out <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-grants-licences-60-online-games-june-2022-06-07/">publishing licenses for videogames</a>, after having directed harsh criticism to the industry in 2021. The People&rsquo;s Bank of China continues to cut/maintain low rates into a world economy where nearly everybody is doing the opposite.</p>
<p>One thing that markets largely ignored during the bigtech crackdown was the point of view that it can be highly beneficial to innovative small-cap companies for bigtech to be reigned in, on one hand <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp">net present value</a> would be lower as cash flow estimates would have to be adjusted to reflect the lower probability of the company becoming a monopoly and dominating their industry, on the other, it lowers the cost of growth as there are less almighty competitors in the market thus simplifying their way to becoming a mid-large size company. At the time, global markets were quite inflated and many small-caps were valued based on their most optimistic growth scenarios, many valuations assumed industry domination in just a few years. In the current, more pessimistic environment these scenarios aren&rsquo;t weighed as heavily, the focus is more on survival itself and wheter companies can retain any free cash flow at all, thus making ultra-growth scenarios irrelevant while investors are simply seeking adequete returns while avoiding any signs of a liquidity crunch. So while it may take longer for bigtech in China to recover to their past influence [ they might never ], we might see a very good time for innovation, especially considering the current deglobalization trend and the potential for a new cold-war and it&rsquo;s own modern &lsquo;space race&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Seeing as how Chinese politicians have made it clear that they still have affection for their markets and is now arguably done with the message phase and onto the longevity phase, why have Chinese stocks continued dragging along below the Covid-Crash bottom?</p>
<h2 id="the-zero-covid-policy">the &lsquo;Zero-Covid Policy&rsquo;;</h2>
<p>The large Covid wave which hit China in March 2022 caused Chinese stocks to drop 25% in weeks, authorities rushed to enforce <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-26/anger-erupts-at-xi-s-big-white-army-of-lockdown-enforcers">brutal lockdowns</a> and established stricter guidelines for essentially everything related to in-person contact which caused Oxford Economics&rsquo; worldwide supply-chain strain index to climb to a record. The 1st of June Shanghai emerged out of lockdown with just 29 new cases per day versus a peak of 26,000, they had succeeded in protecting the population&rsquo;s physical health. The strategies have [ intentionally or not ] beneficially positioned China off-beat to the rest of the world economy, essentially front-running the recession and thus being able to have easier monetary policy into the Ukrainian war, giving them a unique advantage as tensions mount and deglobalization is encouraged.</p>
<p><img src="/images/china-new-covid-cases-07-18-2022.png" alt="China Daily New Covid-19 Cases"></p>
<p>But economic &amp; political consequences from brutally enforcing lockdowns on a population of 1.4 billion people have also come into the spotlight, especially after the March wave where they had to fight Omicron and it&rsquo;s subvariants while their population looked on at the rest of the free world in awe. During the lockdowns anger began to spread amongst the population and in April there was a large-scale online uprising on WeChat against the Covid-Zero policy and the governments handling of the pandemic, videos critiquing the Shanghai lockdown went viral and mass-censorship ensued, which was also critiqued further. As many western societies early came to accept that getting rid of Covid-19 completely through repeated lockdowns is not a viable goal, the Shanghai lockdown was the equivalent enlightening moment for the Chinese.</p>
<p>From the 22nd of March to the 3rd of May Shanghai suffered 34 thousand hospitalizations regarding Covid, of which <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2022-06-20/tiny-fraction-of-shanghais-hospitalized-covid-patients-develop-severe-illness-study-shows-101901218.html?cxg=web&amp;Sfrom=twitter">less than 0.1% developed into severe cases</a> and those who did were all over 60 or had underlying disease(s). As understanding and treatment options of the virus have gotten better, the initial approach adopted at the beginning of the pandemic is ill-fitted for the current environment where it is easily treated and even prevented with vaccines.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2022 the 20th Party Congress will be held where it will be decided wheter Xi Jinping will get to serve for another 5 year term, this plays an important role in China&rsquo;s continued employment of the Zero-Covid policy, even when it seems to be inefficient. If the policy is drawn back and the economy of China seems to have suffered in vain it will have large consequences of Xi&rsquo;s leadership image and trust within his government. Lots of people would rather trust a doctor who reassures them that a procedure is supposed to hurt than one who admits his mistake and then restarts with a completely different procedure. Trust is also a more crucial element in a government with a very centralized authority structure, in a democracy you need to make a significant portion of the population who previously liked you dislike you, meanwhile in a centralized government it can be enough to spark a takeover or a revolution if 20 powerful politicians take advantage of your weakness.</p>
<p>It simply does not make sense to continue enforcing the Zero-Covid policy other than for political motives, and the political motives will likely no longer be relevant into 2023 as Xi Jinping gets another confirmed term and domestic options of anti-viral treatment and vaccines increase.</p>
<h2 id="on-deglobalization">on deglobalization</h2>
<p>After the US has naively placed all their trust in Asia as nearly all manual labour within manufacturing has been outsourced to China &amp; it&rsquo;s neighbours it looks as if the US wants to pivot back into a more conservative culture to retain population growth rates and domestic labour oppourtunities after having experienced a significant supply-chain shock in 2020-2022 that had them realize how trade dependant they are on China. Roe vs Wade being discarded is an example of the recent restructuring of the empire. Using abortion rights as a way to directly influence the population growth is not anything new, legalization was used by the Bolsheviks in the USSR through the 1920s as a way to increase female productivity and it was later banned in the 1930&rsquo;s to boost birth rates. The development of Roe vs Wade specifically may also just be part of the cultural cycle, but the sanctions causing a drawdown of benefits from outsourcing manual labour is not.</p>
<p><img src="/images/us-population-growth-07-20-2022.png" alt="US Annual Population Growth %"></p>
<p>With the US promoting domestic production and securing their own supply through sanctions on China the Chinese have had to experience hardship mainly in importing the select few wares from western-aligned economies that they don&rsquo;t produce domestically, mainly semiconductors, thus they have invested heavily in domestic production capacity for semiconductors in recent years. This leads to China being less dependant on Taiwan which controls a large share of the semiconductor market. One could argue that this is a signal that China is not looking to control Taiwan anytime soon, since investing huge amounts of capital into building up an industry would seem wasteful when the island next to you that you plan to invade has that capacity covered, <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4133393">and then some</a>. What this also signals is that the Chinese are not looking to solve these issues diplomatically, they would rather get rid of their dependancies, mirroring the USA&rsquo;s strategy.</p>
<p>I would be willing to argue that in any case, wheter China invades Taiwan or not in the near future, it will not be as catastrophic for China&rsquo;s economy as markets would tell you. The fact is that the Eurozone and the US both are significantly economically impaired and one of the major causes, or <em>the</em> major cause, is that they are importing inflation at very high rates while simultaneously exporting less and slowing economic growth.</p>
<p>In the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, for Europe bombarding their largest trading partner with sanctions while already crippled by import inflation would be an incredibly bad idea and if it happens it would likely have a bigger material impact on Europe &amp; the US than on China, as it could very well throw them past the boiling point into significant social unrest [ assuming they haven&rsquo;t passed that point yet ].</p>
<p>The most acute risk in foreign investment in China is the effect of what makes China such a great investment in the first place; their domination of markets. When placing your money in the hands of Chinese companies, i&rsquo;d argue that the worry isn&rsquo;t that they won&rsquo;t make it grow, I think the worry is that they won&rsquo;t take your money or that the increasingly threatened western governments will forbid their citizens from giving them money to slow the inevitable. This is the achilles heel of investment in China and, sadly, I have no clever answer on how to deal with this. One could argue that the western world is so dependant on the SEA region which China controls that it&rsquo;s not possible for deglobalization to take place at a large scale, I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is farfetched and I highly doubt that there will come a time where there is barely any (US/Europe)-China relations.</p>
<p>At the same time I would also say that it&rsquo;s not farfetched for the US to prohibit investment in Chinese companies while still allowing for US corporations to operate in China. It likely won&rsquo;t be worth it for the US to completely forbid investment in Chinese companies as the retaliation that China might serve to US companies could be detrimental, but you never know what someone who is cornered &amp; desperate might do, even though it seems more logical for the US to try and improve relations.</p>
